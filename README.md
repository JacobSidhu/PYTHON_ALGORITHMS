I am endeavoring to explore and comprehend the underlying principles of algorithms, aiming to grasp their inner workings. In this pursuit, I am actively engaged in crafting my versions of algorithms, acknowledging that they may resemble existing ones. However, the primary objective is to independently develop these algorithms to enhance my understanding and mastery of their mechanics.
